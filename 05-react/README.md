1. Creating a new project with Vite `npm create vite@latest`
   - Choose a name for the folder for your app, in the example here it is `oscar-awards`;
   - Open the folder `cd oscar-awards/`
   - Install all packages defined as dependencies for the app to start by running `npm install`
   - Run the app by `npm run dev` and open the suggested page http://localhost:5173/ in your browser
2. Your home page
   - `npm install -s sass` we need a new package to handle styling
3. Adding a second page using a router
   - `npm install -s react-router-dom` we need a new package to handle routing
4. Creating a new component

### References: 
- [React](https://react.dev/) - allows to build a powerful dynamic frontend applications
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - helps to a build different versions of frontend applications faster and easier by handling all the package dependencies (we are now talking about React + Javascript, but there can be multiple combinations, like vue + typescript). In Trustpilot we are mostly using React and Typescript combination.
