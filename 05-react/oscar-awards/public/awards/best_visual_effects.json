  "description": "It was not until 1938 when a film was actually recognized for its effects work, when a \"Special Achievement Award for Special Effects\" was given to the Paramount film Spawn of the North. The following year, \"Best Special Effects\" became a recognized category, although on occasion the Academy has chosen to honor a single film outright rather than nominate two or more films. From 1939 to 1963, it was an award for a film's visual effects as well as audio effects, so it was often given to two persons, although some years only one or the other type of effect was recognized. In 1964, it was given only for visual effects, and the following year the name of the category was changed to \"Best Special Visual Effects\".",
