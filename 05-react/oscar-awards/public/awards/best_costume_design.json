  "description": "The Academy Award for Best Costume Design was first given in 1949, for films made in 1948. Initially, separate award categories were established for black-and-white films and color films. Since the merger of the two categories in 1967, the academy has traditionally avoided giving out the award to films with a contemporary setting.",
